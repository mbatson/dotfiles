#+TITLE: Talon Config Documentation

* Installation
Note: The folder "mbatson" is not necessary. It is only being used to keep my personal commands seperated from others' configs that I want to use concurrently. All these files can simply be dropped in ~.talon/user/~ without ~mbatson/~ and will work the same.
** Microsoft Windows
Place all files in:
~C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Talon\user\~
** Linux
Place all files in:
~\~/.talon/user/~
