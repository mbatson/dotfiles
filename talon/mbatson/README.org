* Talon Config Documentation
These are my personal talon commands, which I am running concurrently with [[https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon][knausj_talon]].
** Installation
Note: The folder "mbatson" is not necessary. It is only being used to keep my personal commands separated from others' configs that I want to use concurrently. All these files can simply be dropped in =.talon/user/= without =mbatson/= and will work the same.
*** Microsoft Windows
Place all files in:
=C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Talon\user\=
*** Linux
Place all files in:
=~/.talon/user/=
